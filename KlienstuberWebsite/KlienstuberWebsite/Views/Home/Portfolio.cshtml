    <h1>Simply Seniors</h1>
    <h3>Created by Bit Breakers</h3>
    <p>
        The <img src="~/Images/BitBreakers.png" style="height:50px; width:160px;" /> team (my Senior Capstone Project team name) came together to create a web application for seniors.
        <br />For those who are 65 years of age and older who want a place to connect with others and access the myriad of services available, our social media web application called <i>Simply Seniors</i> is a platform to enable these interactions within your community. <img src="~/Images/SimplySeniorsRegister.png" style="width:70%;" />
        <br /><i>Simply Seniors</i> hosts several features that users may interact with such as: Services, Events, News, Mapping, Live Weather and much more. Create a profile and customize your information utilizing a comprehensive and easy to use user interface that keeps the technical requirements to a minimum while you make friends, attend events, and just have fun. We wanted to create an atmosphere of inclusion, understanding and simplicity to allow every user equal access to all the applications features. <i>Simply Seniors</i> is the culmination of our team vision to provide a platform for seniors to use that was easy to navigate, positive, and useful so you may access resources that are important to you.
