    <h1>Fun Facts About Myself</h1>
    <ol> 
       <li>I love musicals of all types (Hamilton, Dear Evan Hansen, Rent, Book of Mormon, etc).</li>
       <li>I love shows like How I Met Your Mother, The Office, Breaking Bad, BoJack Horseman, and many others.</li>
       <li>I try to run daily with my boyfriend to stay in shape, especially during quarantine where we're all stuck inside for quite some time.</li>
       <li> I am obsessed with coffee and inspirational/happy quotes, and often, these two things collide for me. For example, I have a ton of pictures of coffee in my room, as well as pictures of inspirational quotes with pretty background images.</li>
       <li>I love the rain, and way prefer the rain compared to super hot (80+ degree) weather; however I am a bonafide optimist, and I love all things "Happy", like the sun, the color orange, and positive vibes.</li>
       <li>I like to read when I can (Jack Kerouac or poetry books).</li>
       <li>I love playing Jackbox with my friends and family, as well as most board games.</li>
       <li>If I play video games, it would have to be puzzling games like Portal or Town of Salem, or basically any Mario game.</li>
       <li>My favorite animal would definitely be birds, and I enjoy bird watching when I'm bored and/or have the time.</li>
